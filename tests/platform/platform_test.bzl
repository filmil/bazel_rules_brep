"""Analysis test for spec P1: the fallback toolchain's message.

This checks the message on the fallback toolchain target itself. That
Bazel resolves to it on another host is checked by a CI step that builds
with --host_platform set to //tests/platform:macos_arm64: an analysis test
cannot, because under expect_failure the fallback's failure becomes a
target without ToolchainInfo, and toolchain resolution then aborts the
build.
