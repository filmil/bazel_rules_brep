"""Providers and rules for the toolchains of rules_brep.

Every tool an action or a test runs comes from a toolchain (spec section
"Toolchains"). A tool toolchain returns `platform_common.ToolchainInfo`
with a `tools` dict, from tool name to `FilesToRunProvider`; `run_tool`
looks a tool up there by name. The helpers toolchain brings this module's
own Go helpers: the launcher every action runs through, and the checker of
the swap test. The stub tool is used directly by stub tool toolchains.
