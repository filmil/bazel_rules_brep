    """Runs a tool from a toolchain, with a private home, as one action.

    The tool comes from `ctx.toolchains[toolchain_type].tools[tool]`. It runs
    under the launcher, which points HOME, TMPDIR and the XDG directories,
    and each variable named in `home_env`, at a fresh directory inside the
    action, so the tool reads and writes no host configuration (spec H3).

    A toolchain can add to the tool's environment and inputs, through
    optional fields of its `ToolchainInfo`:

    * `env`: dict of fixed values;
    * `path_env`: dict from name to a path relative to the execution root;
      the tool sees it made absolute;
    * `tool_inputs`: depset of files the tool reads, such as its libraries.

    Values the rule passes win over the toolchain's.

    Args:
      ctx: the rule context. The rule's `toolchains` must include
        `toolchain_type` and `RUN_TOOL_TOOLCHAINS`.
      toolchain_type: the toolchain type that provides the tool.
      tool: the tool's name in that toolchain's `tools` dict.
      arguments: the tool's arguments: strings or `Args` objects.
      inputs: the action's inputs.
      outputs: the action's outputs. The launcher also passes them to the
        tool in RUN_TOOL_OUTPUTS, which the swap test's stub uses.
      mnemonic: the action's mnemonic.
      progress_message: the action's progress message.
      env: fixed environment values for the tool.
      home_env: names of variables to point at directories of their own in
        the private home, such as `KICAD_CONFIG_HOME`.
      tools: more executables the action needs, from toolchains.
