    The targets are built with `--@hdlf_rules_brep//brep/toolchains:use_stub`,
    so each tool toolchain that honors the flag resolves to the stub tool.
    The stub writes a record into every output, files and directories
    alike. The test fails if any output file of the targets lacks the
    record: some action made it without a toolchain tool.

    Example:

    ```starlark
    swap_test(
        name = "swap_test",
        targets = [":gerbers", ":bom"],
    )
    ```

    Args:
      name: the test's name.
      targets: targets whose outputs must all come from the stub.
      **kwargs: common test attributes, such as `size` and `tags`.
